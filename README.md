## Description

This Module 18 Challenge was to create a social network API through MongoDB and Mongoose so that we could create, read, update, and delete the following: users, a user's thoughts, friends, and each thought's reactions.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about MongoDB, Mongoose along with Node.js and Express.js in conjunction with the first two mentioned.

I was able to learn everything I listed above, and look forward to putting these kinds of applications together in future projects.
